# GDLTweets
Scraping Twitter using the key term "dignity" in our five countries of interest (Brazil, India, US, Canada, South Africa) to see cross-relevance with key issues facing the nations.
The CSV files contain already scraped and collected results from Twitter. In the folder "disability", the file names include the country name and the key phrase that was used to search. 
Disablityies means we used the phrase "disability" OR "disabilities" in the search phrase. 

The file GDL Tweet Visualization contains a time-series plot that indicates the number of tweets over time related to the specific phrase. 

Requirements:
- An Academic Research Access Twitter API account (you can apply it via Twitter for free!)
